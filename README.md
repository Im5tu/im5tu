*As a .NET developer, you understand the importance of writing efficient, scalable, and maintainable code. One design pattern that can help achieve these goals is the Singleton pattern. The Singleton pattern is a creational pattern that ensures only one instance of a class is created and provides global access to that instance throughout the application. In this blog post, weâ€™ll look in-depth at the Singleton pattern, exploring its benefits, use cases, and implementation in C#.*

*Welcome to the 10th edition of Observed! Your weekly newsletter, where I bring you a tip you can implement in your infrastructure across many categories like AWS, Terraform and General DevOps practices. This weekâ€™s edition looks at the practice of Chaos Engineering.
What is Chaos Engineering? Chaos engineering is an innovative approach to testing and enhancing complex systemsâ€™ reliability, resilience, and robustness. Born out of a need to ensure system stability in the face of unpredictable events, chaos engineering involves intentionally injecting faults, errors, and failures into a system to evaluate its behaviour and improve its ability to withstand such occurrences.*
