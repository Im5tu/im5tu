### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Stu, it's a pleasure to e-meet you! I'm part of the platform teams at [Checkout.com](https://www.checkout.com). I work on a variety of projects, including testing out new technologies, performance & scalability, streamlining product teams and general devops stuff.

*As more and more companies get hacked, there is a strong resurgence in the community for the desire to have TLS for everything, everywhere. There are many valuable projects, tools and resources, such as LetsEncrypt available to help both individuals &amp; companies secure their resources. One of those tools is AWS Private Certificate Authority.*

*In a world where we use auto-scaling a lot, its often not just one metric that we will take into consideration when deciding whether or not to scale our applications. For example, we might have a combination of CPU usage, memory usage and web request latency. Some services like AWS CloudWatch Metrics only allow scaling based off a single value. Luckily, we can blend metrics together to create new ones, which we can then use in our scaling policies. A blended metric is made up of however one or more existing metrics that you choose, called aspects, and can be published as if it were any other metric, eg: publish to DataDog&#x2F;Cloudwatch.*

*In a previous post I took a look at how we can utilize .NET event counters to record metrics in our applications. However, I never covered the implementation of how I write the metrics to either CloudWatch or DataDog. In this article, Iâ€™m going to take a look at how to publish metrics to CloudWatch and one way of integrating it with the aforementioned blog series.*
- [Building a Zero Trust Architecture In AWS](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;building-a-zero-trust-architecture-in-aws&#x2F;) 
*In the vast majority of companies that Iâ€™ve been in, software engineering &amp; infrastructure best practises have often been left as something that needs to be updated later because building the product comes first. This is completely understandable as if you donâ€™t have a product, you donâ€™t have employment. This presents problems later when companies are beginning to scale rapidly and become popular. Not only does the company becomes a target for malicious actors, but security-related incidents can easily occur by leaving storage devices open accidentally. Once a malicious actor is in your system, you usually have pretty big problems unless you design your architectures with Zero Trust in mind.*
- [Using Moq with ref, in and out parameters in C#](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;using-moq-with-ref-in-and-out-parameters-in-c&#x2F;) 
*In this article, I want to take a look at a scenario that I came across this week which Iâ€™ve come across a few times. Occasionally, you will have an interface that you wish to mock out with Moq and find you have troubles because the method signature takes a ref or an out parameter. This week, Iâ€™ve found a way that we can successfully mock the method without too much of a change to the test code.*
