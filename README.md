### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Stu, it's a pleasure to e-meet you! I'm part of the platform teams at [Checkout.com](https://www.checkout.com). I work on a variety of projects, including testing out new technologies, performance & scalability, streamlining product teams and general devops stuff.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on build out [OpenMessage](https://github.com/im5tu/OpenMessage) (my experimental messaging framework) & [Rafters](https://github.com/im5tu/Rafters) (an experiment in building out RAFT consensus in C#).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning for my AWS Architect exams & streaming systems

- [Architecture Pathway Introduction](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;architecture-pathway-introduction&#x2F;) 
*Over the past year or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of mentoring people on their software development journeys. Some of those personnel have expressed a desire to pursue the software architect route. As it&amp;rsquo;s something that I often refer to, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to post a mini-pathway to help guide on some of the basics.*
- [My Favourite Git Aliases](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;my-favourite-git-aliases&#x2F;) 
*Git aliases are used to create new git commands that can either invoke a function, or be used to create commands that map to longer commands. For example, we could map git co to git checkout or have git undo undo our previous commit. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you some of my favourite git aliases.*
- [Diagnostics in .Net Core 3: An alternative approach to using dotnet-counters with Docker](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;diagnostics-in-.net-core-3-an-alternative-approach-to-using-dotnet-counters-with-docker&#x2F;) 
*In a previous article, we took a look at a way to use dotnet-counters with an external image. This article takes a look at how we can embed the tooling that we require into the image so that we extract the counter&#x2F;memory information as required. This approach does not require elevated permissions as before.*
- [Diagnostics in .Net Core 3: Listening to inbound HTTP requests](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;diagnostics-in-.net-core-3-listening-to-inbound-http-requests&#x2F;) 
*In my previous article we took a look at how to monitor outbound HTTP requests using a DiagnosticListener. In this article, we will re-use some of the same components to monitor inbound HTTP requests. We could use middleware to do as most approaches do, but this approach is highly dependent on the middleware that you have and the duration of this, so we will re-use some of the code from last time.*
- [Diagnostics in .Net Core 3: Listening to outbound HTTP requests](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;diagnostics-in-.net-core-3-listening-to-outbound-http-requests&#x2F;) 
*Throughout the course of my Diagnostics in .Net Core series, we&amp;rsquo;ve taken a look at the basics of how to use the Event Counters API. In this article, we will take a look at how we can capture all outbound HTTP requests automatically as they occur.*
- [Quick Tip: Minification of assets with Hugo](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;quick-tip-minification-of-assets-with-hugo&#x2F;) 
*Today, I have been doing a general tidy up of my blog repository. One of the things that I decided to do, was reduce the overall amount of whitespace in the generated html files.*
- [Diagnostics in .Net Core 3: Using dotnet-counters with Docker](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;diagnostics-in-.net-core-3-using-dotnet-counters-with-docker&#x2F;) 
*In my previous post, I described how we can leverage the new EventCounter diagnostics API to add custom event counters and listen for built in counters. In this article, I will walk through how we can leverage the dotnet-counters tool with a running docker image.*
- [Diagnostics in .Net Core 3: Event Counters](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;diagnostics-in-.net-core-3-event-counters&#x2F;) 
*Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the new diagnostic improvements in .Net Core 3. Traditionally, I&amp;rsquo;ve always used the great AppMetrics package to capture the metrics from our applications and send scrape them with a Prometheus &amp; Grafana setup. Whilst reading about the improvements, I wondered whether or not it would be possible to push metrics to Prometheus.*
- [Quick Tip: Accessing a Azure DevOps secret from within a scripted step](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;quick-tip-accessing-a-azure-devops-secret-from-within-a-scripted-step&#x2F;) 
*In today&amp;rsquo;s quick tip, we are going to see how we can access a secret that we&amp;rsquo;ve defined in a variable group as part of a Azure DevOps yml based build.*
- [Building a custom build agent image with Docker and Azure DevOps pipelines](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;building-a-custom-build-agent-image-with-docker-and-azure-devops-pipelines&#x2F;) 
*In this article, we will learn how to use a custom dockerfile as the bases for a customised Azure DevOps build agent. There are many reasons why you might want to do this, including running custom tooling that takes a while to setup or tooling that isn&amp;rsquo;t supported yet.*
