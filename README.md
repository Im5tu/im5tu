*Welcome to the 10th edition of Observed! Your weekly newsletter, where I bring you a tip you can implement in your infrastructure across many categories like AWS, Terraform and General DevOps practices. This weekâ€™s edition looks at the practice of Chaos Engineering.
What is Chaos Engineering? Chaos engineering is an innovative approach to testing and enhancing complex systemsâ€™ reliability, resilience, and robustness. Born out of a need to ensure system stability in the face of unpredictable events, chaos engineering involves intentionally injecting faults, errors, and failures into a system to evaluate its behaviour and improve its ability to withstand such occurrences.*

Your weekly newsletter, where I bring you a tip you can implement in your infrastructure across many categories like AWS, Terraform and General DevOps practices. This weekâ€™s edition looks at the differences between continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment.
Continuous Integration Continuous Integration (CI) is the act of integrating code changes into a shared repository, and automated tests verify each integration. The aim is to catch and fix errors early in the development cycle rather than waiting for a significant release.*
