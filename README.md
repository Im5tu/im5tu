*This is the first part of my series taking a look at some of the lesser known features of the C# language. Today we will be looking at index parameters, specifically how to use params with them, and how they are used in C#. With these articles, your millage may vary in terms of usability of these features for day to day programming, so think of this series as raising awareness that these things exist, not that you should use for general purpose programming. Without further adieuâ€¦*

*As more and more companies get hacked, there is a strong resurgence in the community for the desire to have TLS for everything, everywhere. There are many valuable projects, tools and resources, such as LetsEncrypt available to help both individuals &amp; companies secure their resources. One of those tools is AWS Private Certificate Authority.*
- [Blending Metrics Using EventCounters In C#](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;blending-metrics-using-eventcounters-in-c&#x2F;) 
*In a world where we use auto-scaling a lot, its often not just one metric that we will take into consideration when deciding whether or not to scale our applications. For example, we might have a combination of CPU usage, memory usage and web request latency. Some services like AWS CloudWatch Metrics only allow scaling based off a single value. Luckily, we can blend metrics together to create new ones, which we can then use in our scaling policies. A blended metric is made up of however one or more existing metrics that you choose, called aspects, and can be published as if it were any other metric, eg: publish to DataDog&#x2F;Cloudwatch.*

*In a previous post I took a look at how we can utilize .NET event counters to record metrics in our applications. However, I never covered the implementation of how I write the metrics to either CloudWatch or DataDog. In this article, Iâ€™m going to take a look at how to publish metrics to CloudWatch and one way of integrating it with the aforementioned blog series.*
- [Building a Zero Trust Architecture In AWS](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;building-a-zero-trust-architecture-in-aws&#x2F;) 
*In the vast majority of companies that Iâ€™ve been in, software engineering &amp; infrastructure best practises have often been left as something that needs to be updated later because building the product comes first. This is completely understandable as if you donâ€™t have a product, you donâ€™t have employment. This presents problems later when companies are beginning to scale rapidly and become popular. Not only does the company becomes a target for malicious actors, but security-related incidents can easily occur by leaving storage devices open accidentally. Once a malicious actor is in your system, you usually have pretty big problems unless you design your architectures with Zero Trust in mind.*
