### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Stu, it's a pleasure to e-meet you! I'm part of the platform teams at [Checkout.com](https://www.checkout.com). I work on a variety of projects, including testing out new technologies, performance & scalability, streamlining product teams and general devops stuff.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on build out [OpenMessage](https://github.com/im5tu/OpenMessage) (my experimental messaging framework) & [Rafters](https://github.com/im5tu/Rafters) (an experiment in building out RAFT consensus in C#).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning for my AWS Architect exams & streaming systems

*Over the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into the internal architecture setup for Checkout.com and seeing how we can scale it for the next few years. As part of that research, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into the CloudEvents specification as a potential option as the basis for a common event schema across teams.*

*In my previous article, we took a look at setting up a template repository for our .Net projects. Repository templates can massively help with the consistency and startup speed of a new project. In this article, we will take a look at a different repository template that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for work for running our performance tests.*

*Over the past few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been updating some of my projects to latest standards, adding in Github Actions where appropriate etc. Most recently I&amp;rsquo;ve setup a template repository in Github.*

*Recently, we&amp;rsquo;ve had the need to build a few feature toggles in our applications that can be changed at runtime. This article walks through a simple approach that you can use in your applications, including a description of a route to dynamic feature toggles.*
- [Architecture Pathway Introduction](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;architecture-pathway-introduction&#x2F;) 
*Over the past year or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of mentoring people on their software development journeys. Some of those personnel have expressed a desire to pursue the software architect route. As it&amp;rsquo;s something that I often refer to, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to post a mini-pathway to help guide on some of the basics.*
- [My Favourite Git Aliases](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;my-favourite-git-aliases&#x2F;) 
*Git aliases are used to create new git commands that can either invoke a function, or be used to create commands that map to longer commands. For example, we could map git co to git checkout or have git undo undo our previous commit. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you some of my favourite git aliases.*
- [Diagnostics in .Net Core 3: An alternative approach to using dotnet-counters with Docker](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;diagnostics-in-.net-core-3-an-alternative-approach-to-using-dotnet-counters-with-docker&#x2F;) 
*In a previous article, we took a look at a way to use dotnet-counters with an external image. This article takes a look at how we can embed the tooling that we require into the image so that we extract the counter&#x2F;memory information as required. This approach does not require elevated permissions as before.*
- [Diagnostics in .Net Core 3: Listening to inbound HTTP requests](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;diagnostics-in-.net-core-3-listening-to-inbound-http-requests&#x2F;) 
*In my previous article we took a look at how to monitor outbound HTTP requests using a DiagnosticListener. In this article, we will re-use some of the same components to monitor inbound HTTP requests. We could use middleware to do as most approaches do, but this approach is highly dependent on the middleware that you have and the duration of this, so we will re-use some of the code from last time.*
- [Diagnostics in .Net Core 3: Listening to outbound HTTP requests](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;diagnostics-in-.net-core-3-listening-to-outbound-http-requests&#x2F;) 
*Throughout the course of my Diagnostics in .Net Core series, we&amp;rsquo;ve taken a look at the basics of how to use the Event Counters API. In this article, we will take a look at how we can capture all outbound HTTP requests automatically as they occur.*

*Today, I have been doing a general tidy up of my blog repository. One of the things that I decided to do, was reduce the overall amount of whitespace in the generated html files.*
