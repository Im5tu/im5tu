### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Stu, it's a pleasure to e-meet you! I'm part of the platform teams at [Checkout.com](https://www.checkout.com). I work on a variety of projects, including testing out new technologies, performance & scalability, streamlining product teams and general devops stuff.

- ðŸŒ± AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate & AWS Certified Developer Associate
- ðŸ“« You can watch my [YouTube](https://bit.ly/im5tu-yt-sub) videos all on things .NET, contact me on [Twitter](https://bit.ly/im5tu-tw) and read a few entries on [my blog](https://bit.ly/im5tu-articles)
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on build out [OpenMessage](https://github.com/im5tu/OpenMessage) (my experimental messaging framework) & [Rafters](https://github.com/im5tu/Rafters) (an experiment in building out RAFT consensus in C#).

- [Blending Metrics Using EventCounters In C#](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;blending-metrics-using-eventcounters-in-c&#x2F;) 
*In a world where we use auto-scaling a lot, its often not just one metric that we will take into consideration when deciding whether or not to scale our applications. For example, we might have a combination of CPU usage, memory usage and web request latency. Some services like AWS CloudWatch Metrics only allow scaling based off a single value. Luckily, we can blend metrics together to create new ones, which we can then use in our scaling policies. A blended metric is made up of however one or more existing metrics that you choose, called aspects, and can be published as if it were any other metric, eg: publish to DataDog&#x2F;Cloudwatch.*

*In a previous post I took a look at how we can utilize .NET event counters to record metrics in our applications. However, I never covered the implementation of how I write the metrics to either CloudWatch or DataDog. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take a look at how to publish metrics to CloudWatch and one way of integrating it with the aforementioned blog series.*
- [Building a Zero Trust Architecture In AWS](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;building-a-zero-trust-architecture-in-aws&#x2F;) 
*In the vast majority of companies that I&amp;rsquo;ve been in, software engineering &amp; infrastructure best practises have often been left as something that needs to be updated later because building the product comes first. This is completely understandable as if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a product, you don&amp;rsquo;t have employment. This presents problems later when companies are beginning to scale rapidly and become popular. Not only does the company becomes a target for malicious actors, but security-related incidents can easily occur by leaving storage devices open accidentally. Once a malicious actor is in your system, you usually have pretty big problems unless you design your architectures with Zero Trust in mind.*

*In this article, I want to take a look at a scenario that I came across this week which I&amp;rsquo;ve come across a few times. Occasionally, you will have an interface that you wish to mock out with Moq and find you have troubles because the method signature takes a ref or an out parameter. This week, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a way that we can successfully mock the method without too much of a change to the test code.*
- [A Look Into CloudEvents](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;im5tu.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;a-look-into-cloudevents&#x2F;) 
*Over the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into the internal architecture setup for Checkout.com and seeing how we can scale it for the next few years. As part of that research, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into the CloudEvents specification as a potential option as the basis for a common event schema across teams.*
