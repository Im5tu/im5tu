*In this article, weâ€™re going to take a look at how to create a private Helm repository with Github Pages. This guide requires you to have a Github Enterprise license as private Github Pages are only available to enterprise customers. Iâ€™m showing this approach for the scenarios where setting up something like ChartMuseum isnâ€™t possible or unwanted. Although this guide uses helm as the example, you can extend this to host anything under a privately authenticated Github page.*

*In this article weâ€™re taking a look at how to extend the AWS SDK for .NET, which can be useful for various tasks like adding in some custom observability components into the request pipeline. This article is a companion resource for the video linked above in case you prefer a written version. Iâ€™m actively using the approach described here to implement distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry for all AWS calls at work.*

*This is the next part of my series taking a look at some of the lesser known features of the C# language. Today we will be looking at duck typing and how it is used in C#. Much like the previous article, your millage may vary in terms of actually using these features for day to day programming, so think of this series as raising awareness that these things exist, not that you should use for general purpose programming. Without further adieuâ€¦*

One of those tools is AWS Private Certificate Authority.*
